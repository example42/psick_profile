# Hostname and port of the Backup HTTP Server. The hostname will match
# what is used to access the Ops Manager UI. The default port of the
# Backup HTTP Server for an Ops Manager install is 8081. The protocol
# (http(s)://) should NOT be included. It is controlled by the `https`
# setting.

# Communicate with the MMS Backup HTTP Server over SSL.
#
# The default Ops Manager install does not run the Backup HTTP Server with
# SSL. If the `mothership` accepts SSL connections because Ops Manager has
# been configured with SSL or a load balancer has been placed in front
# of Ops Manager doing SSL termination this setting can be changed to true.
